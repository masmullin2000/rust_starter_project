# Rust Starter Project

A basic git repository containing some bare essentials
in order to quickly start a new rust project

Projects start with a lib named "lib" from src/lib.rs
and a bin named "bin" from src/main.rs

## How To Use
```shell
$ git clone --depth 1 https://<insert_url> <my_project_name>
$ rm -rf <my_project_name>/.git
$ cd <my_project_name>
$ git init
```

Where <my_project_name> is the name of the project you want to start
and <insert_url> is the url of the rust_starter_project
